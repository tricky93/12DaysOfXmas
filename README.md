## 12DaysOfXmas

‘The Twelve Days of Christmas’ is a rootin’-tootin’, singalong Christmas carol.

It’s a traditional English tune dating back to the 1700s, which some historians actually believe to have French origins.

The version we know best came from Frederic Austin, an English composer who set the lyrics and added some flourishes – including the drawn out “five go-old rings” – in 1909.
